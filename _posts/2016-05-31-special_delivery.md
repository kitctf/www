Just a small writeup for "Special Delivery" (network 300) from HITB CTF 2016.

For this challenge we're provided with a [pcap](https://github.com/kitctf/writeups/raw/master/hitb2016/special_delivery/5d176b7cb326f05a1985be5d4d4d9074_special_delivery.pcap).

Looking at wireshark reveals two things:

1. The only packets inside the pcap are ICMP packets and IP fragments of ICMP packets
2. The ICMP packets contain interesting payload data

==> Things look a lot like an ICMP tunnel.

Let's get this solved with scapy. I solved the challenge mostly inside an interactive scapy shell so we'll do the same here:

    > scapy
    >>> pcap = rdpcap('5d176b7cb326f05a1985be5d4d4d9074_special_delivery.pcap')
    >>> pcap
    <5d176b7cb326f05a1985be5d4d4d9074_special_delivery.pcap: TCP:0 UDP:0 ICMP:267 Other:41>

Alright, let's get rid of the fragments:

    >>> pcap = defragment(pcap)
    >>> pcap
    <Defragmented 5d176b7cb326f05a1985be5d4d4d9074_special_delivery.pcap: TCP:0 UDP:0 ICMP:267 Other:0>

Good.

It seems not every packet has a payload though:

    >>> pcap[0]
    <Ether  dst=00:50:56:e8:3e:63 src=00:0c:29:c2:2c:40 type=0x800 |<IP  version=4L ihl=5L tos=0x0 len=28 id=22216 flags=DF frag=0L ttl=64 proto=icmp chksum=0x41b0 src=10.13.37.145 dst=192.168.178.34 options=[] |<ICMP  type=echo-request code=0 chksum=0x86e2 id=0x711d seq=0x0 |>>>
    >>> pcap[10]
    <Ether  dst=00:50:56:e8:3e:63 src=00:0c:29:c2:2c:40 type=0x800 |<IP  version=4L ihl=5L tos=0x0 len=88 id=22893 flags=DF frag=0L ttl=64 proto=icmp chksum=0x3ecf src=10.13.37.145 dst=192.168.178.34 options=[] |<ICMP  type=echo-request code=0 chksum=0xa113 id=0x711d seq=0x0 |<Raw  load='E\x00\x00<#\xe1@\x00@\x06\xfc\xd8\n\x00\x03\x02\n\x00\x03\x01\xba\xa1\x00P\xbb4\xd5\x89\x00\x00\x00\x00\xa0\x02r\x10y\x94\x00\x00\x02\x04\x05\xb4\x04\x02\x08\n\x00=\xf6h\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01\x03\x03\n' |>>>>

Let's remove the ones that don't have any content:

    >>> packets = [p for p in pcap if Raw in p]

Looking at the ICMP payloads, it looks like there's some binary stuff in every packet...
At this point I made a simple guess and assumed that the payload in the ICMP packets were IP packets themselves.
We can quickly verify this:

    >>> ip = IP(packets[0][Raw].load)
    >>> ip
    <IP  version=4L ihl=5L tos=0x0 len=60 id=9185 flags=DF frag=0L ttl=64 proto=tcp chksum=0xfcd8 src=10.0.3.2 dst=10.0.3.1 options=[] |<TCP  sport=47777 dport=http seq=3140801929 ack=0 dataofs=10L reserved=0L flags=S window=29200 chksum=0x7994 urgptr=0 options=[('MSS', 1460), ('SAckOK', ''), ('Timestamp', (4060776, 0)), ('NOP', None), ('WScale', 10)] |>>

Ok, this looks like a valid IP packet. Especially the dst and src look good.
Let's extract the actual IP packets:

    >>> packets = PacketList([IP(p[Raw].load) for p in packets])
    >>> packets
    <PacketList: TCP:175 UDP:0 ICMP:0 Other:0>

We could probably do the next steps with Wireshark, but let's write some more python while we're at it.

Quickly scanning the communication (e.g. `packets.summary()`), it looks like there are only two parties involved.
Let's split the packets by source IP (and filter out packets without content again):

    >>> client_packets = PacketList([p for p in packets if p[IP].src == '10.0.3.2' and Raw in p])
    >>> server_packets = PacketList([p for p in packets if p[IP].src == '10.0.3.1' and Raw in p])

Looking at the first few client packets (e.g. `client_packets[:10].hexdump()`) shows us that this is an HTTP GET request. Let's dump the response body to a file.

    >>> response = ''.join(packet[Raw].load for packet in server_packets)
    >>> header_length = response.find('\r\n\r\n') + 4
    >>> print(response[:header_length])
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Ok, seems like the rest of the communication is encrypted using SSL through stunnel. Luckily we have the certificate (stunnel.pem).. and apparently no forward secrecy was used ;)

We'll now need Wireshark. For that we can either write a new pcap file containing the actual IP traffic:

    >>> wrpcap('special_delivery.pcap', packets)

Or, even simpler, start Wireshark directly from scapy:

    >>> wireshark(packets)

First we'll need to mark the encrypted packets as SSL traffic: `Rightclick -> Decode As -> SSL`.
There's a feature in wireshark for decrypting SSL traffic. It's somewhat hidden though: `Preferences -> Protocols -> SSL -> RSA keys list -> Key File`.
Now all that remains is to rightclick on one of the TLS packets and "Follow [the] SSL Stream":

    id
    uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
    cd /root
    cat .flag
    HitB{b3a64ecf6978f0593ed20ee15a02ef36}
    exit
