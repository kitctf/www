You know GitHub Actions, these small building blocks that make your dev life easierâ€¦ But they can also get you pwned in no time, if you are not careful.

The talk covers:
* the basic structure of a GitHub Actions workflow.
* the general permission model of GitHub Actions.
* insecure templating and executing user-controlled code in privileged workflows.
* cache poisoning in workflows.

The slides can be found [here](/talks/2023-10-26-insecure-github-actions/insecure-github-actions.pdf). The workshop was held on 2023-10-26.
