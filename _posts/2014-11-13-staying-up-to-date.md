tl;dr just subscribe to [r/netsec on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/).\\
The following is a list of sources to help you stay up-to-date in infosec. If you're just starting out it probably still can't hurt to read some of the posts and try to understand them. More often than not they'll also point you to introductory resources for the topic.

### Mailing lists
- [full-disclosure](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/)
- [bugtraq](http://seclists.org/bugtraq/)
- [oss-sec](http://seclists.org/oss-sec/)

### IRC channels (freenode)

### Talks from various conferences

Usually the slides (and possibly white papers or even videos) of the talks will be published on the conference website a couple of days after the conference ended. These are often a great way to learn about current research in the infosec community.

- Chaos Communication Congress (C3)

### Blogs from various companies

A lot of companies active in the infosec industry have their own research blogs. There's usually quite a lot of good content on those, so you're encouraged to check them out. Again you probably want to subscribe to [r/netsec](http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/) since new blog posts will usually be posted there as well.
